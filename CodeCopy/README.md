This is simple Splash Screen App | The Splash screen is used for basically two things. Number one usage of splash screen is to welcome our app users to into the app with a nice UI and the second critical usage is to make sure your app loads all the basic information while the Splash screen is being displayed to the user.

## Implementation
Now the timer is based on `postDelayed()` public method. This method will help us to queue a process to a certain period of time that we set for the method and app will perform that task after that time period.

First we set the time for the timer using a very simple `int SPLASH_TIME` variable
```groovy
int SPLASH_TIME = 3000; //This is 3 seconds
```

```groovy
new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                //Do any action here. Now we are moving to next page
                Intent mySuperIntent = new Intent(ActivitySplash.this, ActivityHome.class);
                startActivity(mySuperIntent);

                //This 'finish()' is for exiting the app when back button pressed from Home page which is ActivityHome
                finish();

            }
        }, SPLASH_TIME);
```
